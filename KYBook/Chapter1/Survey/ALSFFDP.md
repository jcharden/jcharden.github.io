Leverage Deep Belief Network (**DBN**) to automatically learn semantic features from token vectors extracted from programsâ€™ Abstract Syntax Trees (**ASTs**).

## Motivating example

## Prediction process

1) nodes of method invocations and class instance creations
2) declaration nodes, i.e., method declarations, type declarations, and enum declarations, and
3) control-flow nodes such as while statements, catch clauses, if statements, throw statements.
