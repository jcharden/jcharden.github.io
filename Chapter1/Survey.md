# Section2:Survey

tags: properties, labels, texts, tokens, ASTs, graphs

A survey of program analysis using deep-learning or machine-learning.

Mainly include:

- [Vulnerability detection](https://jcharden.github.io/Survey_vd.html)
- [Defect/Fault prediction](https://jcharden.github.io/Survey_sdp.html)
- [Clone detection](https://jcharden.github.io/Survey_cd.html)

Most use [`Code representation`](https://jcharden.github.io/Survey_cr.html) method to learn semantic representation of programs. The `Code representation` mainly includes `properties`, `labels`, `texts`, `tokens`, `ASTs` and `graphs`.
